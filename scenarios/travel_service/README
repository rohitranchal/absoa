Travel_service and client

Description:

1. Client sends the active bundle to the main_service
2. Main_service sends the active bundle to the designated services(flight_service)
3. Designated services read and write to the database of the active bundle (flight_serive reads the passenger information and adds the flight information), and return the active bundle to main_service.
4. Main_service returns the active bundle to the client 

Steps to run the scenario:

1.) To build the service run the following from the "service" directory:
mvn clean install

In flightService/ and service/
2.) Setup an axis2 instance by running "scripts/setup" of the "service" directory.

3.) Build ab_axis2_module project and copy "ab_axis2_module-1.0-SNAPSHOT.mar" from "target" directory into "service/scripts/axis2_server/axis2-1.6.2/repository/modules/"

4.) Run "./start"  in "flightService/scripts" or "service/scripts"

In client/
5.) Run edu.purdue.cs.absoa.samples.simple.App in "client" project.
We will see the ActiveBundle "ABReturn.jar" returned by the Service with the additional flight information in it.
