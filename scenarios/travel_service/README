Travel_service and client

Description: 
1. The client sends the active bundle to the main_service. 
2. The main service will send the active bundle to the desinated services(flight_service). 
3. The services reads and writes to the database of the active bundle (flight_service adds the flight and ticket information to the active bundle database) and send the active bundle back to the main_service. 
4. Finally the main_service sends the active bundle back to the client.

Steps to run the scenario:

1.) To build the service run the following from the "service" and "flight_service" directory:
mvn clean install

In service/ and flightService/:
2.) Setup an axis2 instance by running "scripts/setup" of the "service" directory.

3.) Build ab_axis2_module project and copy "ab_axis2_module-1.0-SNAPSHOT.mar" from "target" directory into "service/scripts/axis2_server/axis2-1.6.2/repository/modules/"

4.) Run "./start"  in "flightService/scripts" or in "service/scripts".

In client/:
5.) Run edu.purdue.cs.absoa.samples.simple.App in "client" project.
We will see the ActiveBundle "ABReturn.jar" returned by the Service with the additional flight information in it.
